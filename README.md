# Codes related to the deep learning course

In this repository, I have implemented common problems in the deep learning domain. 

**Back-propagation, CNN, RNN (GRU, LSTM), auto-encoders, word-embedding, and reinforcement learning are the main blocks that have been implemented in this repository.**
